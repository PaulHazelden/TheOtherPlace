# Jesus and the Other Place: Summary

The book is both a clear, accessible statement of the Bible's teaching 
about Hell for those who have no background in theology or Biblical Studies, 
and also a comprehensive survey of the more complicated issues and doctrines 
around the subject of Hell and who goes there.  It clearly presents what 
Jesus tells us about Hell, which is very different from the medieval picture 
we are familiar with.
