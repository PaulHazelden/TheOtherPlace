# Jesus and the Other Place: Summary

## One Summary

The book is a clear and accessible statement of the Bible's teaching 
about Hell, and a brief but comprehensive survey of the more complicated issues and doctrines 
around the subject of Hell - what it is and who goes there.  It clearly presents what 
Jesus tells us about Hell, which is very different from the medieval picture 
we are often presented with.

## About this book

This book seeks to take seriously what Jesus tells us about the fate of those who do not follow him. The message Jesus gives us about the next world can be found throughout the Bible, and can be summarised very simply: we are offered two paths, and we can choose between two possible futures â€“ we can receive eternal life, or we can perish.

Traditional mainstream Christian teaching says the unsaved will suffer eternal torment, but this is not the biblical message. The doctrine of eternal torment distorts the gospel message, disrupts our evangelism, and makes honest and sensitive pastoral care for the bereaved even harder than it is already. Even worse, it presents our Heavenly Father as a cruel monster.
