The main objection I hear from Christians who have not read the book is this:

"You are wrong - I know that Hell is real, because the Bible says so."

Yes, the Bible does talk about Hell.  Actually, it talks about several different 
Hells, but that's a detail we don't need to go into at this point.  The question 
is not whether Hell is real, in any meaningful sense; the question we need to
consider is: what is the nature of Hell?

People often think they know what Hell is - a place of eternal conscious torment.
So when the Bible talks about Hell, they assume that this is what the Bible is
talking about - and this assumption is reinforced by centuries of teaching by
mainstream Christian denominations.

But our beliefs should not be based on traditions or human ideas: as Christians,
and especially as evangelical Christians, our beliefs should be based on what the 
Bible teaches us.  And what the Bible teaches us about Hell and the fate of those
who reject God is very different from what we have usually been taught.
