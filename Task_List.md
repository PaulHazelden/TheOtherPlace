# Jesus and the Other Place: Task List

This is a list of things to do, some of which are down to me, but others I am going to need help with.

1. **Add more detail** about the book in this repository, so people have a better idea what we are talking about

1. **Complete the SPCK submission.**  There is a form which needs to be filled in, and to get the emotional energy to finish it: some help would be appreciated. 

1. **Collect personal stories**
   Asking people about their personal experience is an excellent idea, but will take time. It could result
   in a companion piece, but this is work I can't do on my own.  Is someone interested in collecting 
   testimonies about the impact of belief in (and being told you must believe in) eternal torment?

1. **Clarify the options.**
  Would SPCK (or other publishers) be less likely to publish if it is already available as an ebook?
  What do I actually have to lose in releasing it this way?

1. **Collect reviews.**
  People have said and written lots of good and encouraging things about the book, but I have not 
  collated them, and I have not asked permission to share them.  This is something else someone 
  could help with.
