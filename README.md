Within Christian theology: exploring what the Bible actually says about Hell

# Background

This project started off as some notes prepared for evangelical Christians, 
to help them understand that (despite what they have been told) the Bible 
does not teach that the unsaved will spend eternity being tormented in Hell.

I started to collate the notes in 1999, and they were uploaded to my website 
on 5 November 2001 as 
"[What is the Fate of the Wicked?](http://hazelden.org.uk/pt03/art_pt121_fate_of_wicked.htm)".
The article was revised a few times; the last update was made on 18 May 2016.

After this I decided to write a book on the Kingdom of Heaven and, in order to gain 
some experience of writing and publishing a book, it seemed like a good idea to
pull the material together into book form and get it published.

Since then it has been reviewed and revised countless times, with copies sent to
at least 63 people - there were others I forgot to note at the time, and others who
had it passed on to them by someone else.  We are currently on version 11.112 
(that is, the 112th revision of the 11th major version). Along the way, there have 
been two major re-writes.

Almost all the feedback I have received has been concerning the structure of the 
book, rather than the actual content.  And almost all the suggested changes said
it would be better if *this* content was covered earlier.  In essence, whatever I
say, it would be better if something else had been said first. At present, I'm
not planning to make any further changes to the structure, or the order in which 
topics are covered.

Almost all the remaining feedback suggested that it would be better if I included 
stories of some people who have been affected by the doctrine of eternal torment.
While I don't disagree with this idea, it would be a very different book - but,
possibly, a more popular one.  However, I can't edit this book and turn it into 
that one without losing  a great deal that other people found helpful.

The book was accepted for publication by Lion Hudson, but it was then bogged down 
in another round of edits, and before a publication date could be set Lion Hudson 
were taken over, and the new owners decided that it did not fit into their 
product lineup.  I have found that the subject of Hell repels and scares many people, 
who make all kinds of assumptions about the content without reading a word.

Since then, I have not had the emotional energy to jump through the hoops needed to
persuade another publisher to take it on.

# Why Publication?

A number of people have asked: why try to find a publisher?  Why not just 
publish it myself, or put it up on the Internet?  There are several reasons.

- Publication by a respected publishing house will give the material credibility,
  and make it more likely that journals will review it, bookshops will stock it,
  and Bible Colleges will use it as a textbook or recommend it as a reference work.
- A publisher will put some resources into publicising it, and I don't have the
  capacity to do a great deal of promotion.
- I don't have the finances to go down the full self-publishing route.
- A publishing house is likely to produce a better quality product (apart from
  anything else, the current index is extensive and functional, but not pretty).

That said, in the end, if the choice is between self publishing and not 
publishing at all, I'll go for the self-publishing option.

# Next Steps

Quite a lot needs to be done before the book can be published, but it doesn't 
all need to be done quickly, and it doesn't all need to be done by me. The aim
of creating this repository is to break down the tasks so that the various 
parts become more manageable, and to make it possible for other people to step
in and help.
