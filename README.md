Within Christian theology: exploring what the Bible actually says about Hell

# Background

This project started off as some notes prepared for evangelical Christians, 
to help them understand that (despite what they have been told) the Bible 
does not teach that the unsaved will spend eternity being tormented in Hell.

I started to collate the notes in 1999, and they were uploaded to my website 
on 5 November 2001 as 
"[What is the Fate of the Wicked?](http://hazelden.org.uk/pt03/art_pt121_fate_of_wicked.htm)".
The article was revised a few times; the last update was made on 17 May 2016.

After this I decided to write a book on the Kingdom of Heaven and, in order to gain 
some experience of writing and publishing a book, it seemed like a good idea to
pull the material together into book form and get it published.
