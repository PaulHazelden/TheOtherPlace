# Jesus and the Other Place

Within the discipline of Christian theology, this is a book which unpacks 
what the Bible actually says about Hell.

# Background

This project started off as some notes prepared for evangelical Christians, 
to help them understand that (despite what they have been told) the Bible 
does not teach that the unsaved will spend eternity being tormented in Hell.

I started to collate the notes in 1999, and they were uploaded to my website 
in November 2001 as 
"[What is the Fate of the Wicked?](http://hazelden.org.uk/pt03/art_pt121_fate_of_wicked.htm)".
The article was revised a few times; the last update was made in May 2016.

After this I decided to write a book on the Kingdom of Heaven and, in order to gain 
some experience of writing and publishing a book, it seemed like a good idea to
put the notes on Hell into book form and get it published quickly. Then, with a 
better understanding of what I'm doing, I could prepare the material on Heaven as
a book.  As I say, it seemed like a good idea at the time.

Writing the first draft of the book (at the time, called 'The Other Place') took a 
couple of months, alongside various other activities.  Then I started to circulate 
it for comment and tried to get it published.

Since then it has been reviewed and revised countless times, with copies sent to
at least 64 people - there were others I forgot to note at the time, and others who
had it passed on to them by someone else.  We are currently on version 11.112 
(that is, the 112th revision of the 11th major version). Along the way, there have 
been two major re-writes.

The online article - which is still available - was 23,746 words long, including the 
footnotes.  The latest draft of the book, now called 'Jesus and the Other Place', is 
86,792 words and 345 pages when formatted as a A5 document.  A lot of detail has 
been added, but the online article still provides the basic content.

The late and much lamented Roger Forster was good enough to write a foreword when 
I was first trying to get the book published.  I am sorry that he never saw it in print.

Apart from the spelling mistakes and grammatical errors (which I am very grateful to 
have pointed out), 
almost all the feedback I have received has suggested changes to the structure of the 
book, rather than the actual content.  And almost all the suggested changes said
it would be better if *this* specific piece of content was covered earlier.  I did 
move some content around a few times, and discovered that it didn't help.

The core problem here is that everything is connected - at least, all the important
details are.  There are several important, related and non-trivial things which need 
to be understood reasonably well, in order that any of them can be properly 
understood.  So, in order to properly understand any one of them, you need to 
adequately understand the others first. As a consequence, there is no ideal sequence 
in which the material should be covered - whatever I say first, it would be better 
if something else had been said first. So I'm not currently planning to make any 
further changes to the structure, and in particular I'm not planning to change the 
order in which topics are covered.

Almost all the remaining feedback suggested that it would be better if I included 
stories of some people who have been affected by the doctrine of eternal torment.
While I don't disagree with this idea, it would be a very different book - but,
possibly, a more popular one.  However, I can't edit this book and turn it into 
that one without losing  a great deal that other people found helpful.

The book was accepted for publication by Lion Hudson, but it was then bogged down 
in another round of edits, and before a publication date could be set Lion Hudson 
were taken over, and the new owners decided that it did not fit into their 
product lineup.  I have found that the subject of Hell repels and scares many people, 
who make all kinds of assumptions about the content without reading a word.

Since then, I have not had the emotional energy to jump through the hoops needed to
persuade another publisher to take it on.

# Why Publication?

A number of people have asked: why try to find a publisher?  Why not just 
publish it myself, or put it up on the Internet?  There are several reasons.

- Publication by a respected publishing house will give the material credibility,
  which has several benefits: it will aid sales, 
  and make it more likely that journals will review it, bookshops will stock it,
  and Bible Colleges will use it as a textbook or recommend it as a reference work.
- A publisher will put some resources into publicising it, and I don't have the
  capacity to do a great deal of promotion; also, I will find it easier to publicise
  a book published by someone else.
- I don't have the finances to go down the full self-publishing route.
- A publishing house is likely to produce a better quality product (apart from
  anything else, the current index is extensive and functional, but not pretty).

That said, in the end, if the choice is between self publishing and not 
publishing at all, I'll go for the self-publishing option. If you would like to be

To state the (possibly) obvious - I'm not doing this to make money out of the book:
the main aim of getting it published is to enable as many people as possible to
benefit from the content.

# Next Steps

Quite a lot needs to be done before the book can be published, but it doesn't 
all need to be done quickly, and it doesn't all need to be done by me. 
The main aim of creating this repository is to make information about the book,
(along with the process of getting it published and dealing with the issues it 
raises) accessible to friends and the public at large.
One thing I have recently done is to break down the tasks so that the various 
parts become more manageable, and to make it easier for other people to step
in and help.

If you would like to support the publication of *Jesus and the Other Place*,
or you have a story about the impact that believing in eternal conscious torment 
of the unsaved had on you - or of the consequences of being told that you must
believe it, when you had doubts - then please complete [this short 
form](https://forms.gle/WdtHYqaW535saqzB9). Thanks!

The current [Task List](Task_List.md) includes links to the other
information about the book and progress towards publication.
