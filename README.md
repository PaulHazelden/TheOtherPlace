# Jesus and the Other Place

Jesus and the Other Place:
What the Bible
really says about Hell,
and the difference this makes
to our evangelism and pastoral care.

The book deals with Christian theology,
primarily from an evangelical perspective;
but the impact of the content affects many people
who provide pastoral care, and every Christian
who talks about their faith with others.

# Background

This project started off as some notes prepared for evangelical Christians, 
to help them understand that (despite what they have been told) the Bible 
does not teach that the unsaved will spend eternity being tormented in Hell.

I started to collate the notes in 1999, and they were uploaded to my website 
in November 2001 as 
"[What is the Fate of the Wicked?](http://hazelden.org.uk/pt03/art_pt121_fate_of_wicked.htm)".
The article was revised a few times; the last update was made in May 2016.

After this I decided to write a book on the Kingdom of Heaven and, in order to gain 
some experience of writing and publishing a book, it seemed like a good idea to
put the notes on Hell into book form and get it published quickly. Then, with a 
better understanding of what I'm doing, I could prepare the material on Heaven as
a book.  As I say, it seemed like a good idea at the time.

Writing the first draft of the book (at the time, called 'The Other Place') took a 
couple of months, alongside various other activities.  Then I started to circulate 
it for comment and tried to get it published.

Since then it has been reviewed and revised countless times, with copies sent to
around 70 people; there were others I forgot to note at the time, and others who
had it passed on to them by someone else. Along the way, there have been two significant 
re-writes.  The book is now called 'Jesus and the Other Place'; a lot of detail has 
been added, but the online article still provides the basic content.

The late and much lamented Roger Forster was good enough to write a foreword when 
I was first trying to get the book published.  I am sorry that he never saw it in print.

If you have read it, please leave a review! Thank you.

If the review contains questions or suggestions for improvement, then
[the feedback form](https://forms.gle/WdtHYqaW535saqzB9) is still available 
for you to use.  And I would still be interested in hearing if
you have a story about the impact that believing in eternal conscious torment 
of the unsaved had on you - or of the consequences of being told that you must
believe it. Thanks!
