# Jesus and the Other Place: First Pitch (August 2016)

## 1. Give us the heart of the book in a 100 words?

“What the Bible really says about Hell”

Traditional teaching about Hell talks about eternal torment but, if you approach the
Bible without a prior belief in eternal torment, you would never discover that doctrine
within its pages.

What the Bible consistently tells us about the fate of the unsaved is that they will
die, perish or be destroyed. This is taught throughout the Old and New Testaments;
including by Jesus, Peter, Paul and John.

We consider every significant passage teaching about the afterlife, including every
passage used to support eternal torment, and consider the consequences of these
beliefs.

## 2. How will your readers benefit from your book?

If they are persuaded by the message, they will be able to talk with others about
what happens after death. They will be able to talk with people who have been
bereaved and lost someone who was not a believer without either referring to the lost
one burning in Hell or feeling guilty about having fudged the issue. They will be able
to talk to others about God’s love, goodness and justice without fear of being asked
how this loving, gracious and just God can torment people for all eternity.

Many readers will be relieved to discover that the Bible, in passage after passage,
means exactly what it clearly says.

Some readers will be empowered to speak up for what they have believed for years
but felt unable to admit in public because it was not ‘sound teaching’.

Some readers will be relieved to find a Biblical alternative to the Universalism they
feared was the only viable alternative to believing that the God they worship seems to
be a monster.

If they are not persuaded by the message, at the very least they should be able to
accept that their fellow Christians who believe that the final fate of unbelievers is
destruction are not denying Jesus or the clear teaching of the Bible, and the question
of what happens to unbelievers after death is less settled than they had previously
thought.

The book includes a comprehensive index of Biblical passages referenced in the
text, so it can be used as a reference work when they talk to someone else about the
subject and encounter the common response, “Ah, but what about this passage?”

## 3. Why are you qualified to be the person to write this book?

I am theologically literate, with a MTh in Applied Theology.

I have worked within and alongside churches and Christian organisations from a
wide range of denominations and theological traditions.

I have extensive experience of talking with people, both outside the Church and
within it, about matters of faith.

For much of the last 20 years, I have been working with alcoholics and drug
addicts: people who have a high risk of dying, and who frequently know someone
who has recently died and who need to talk about it.

The basic content of the book has been tested in a range of contexts over a period
of about 25 years.

My writing style, so I am told, is clear and engaging.

Few people, it seems, are prepared to put their head above the parapet and admit
they do not follow the traditional belief in eternal torment.

## 4. How are you connecting already with your potential readers?

I have been talking with many people about this subject, and received a great deal
of encouragement to press on and write the book.

I am well known and well-connected in Bristol, primarily though my work with
homeless people, alcoholics and drug addicts.

I have given drafts of the book to a diverse set of 18 Christians so far. They come
from both sexes, with a range of denominations and theological traditions, cultural
backgrounds and ages. I have received extensive feedback on earlier drafts, and the
initial readers were keen to see the work finished and in print.

Both from my general conversations and from the specific feedback on the book, I
believe that this is very much an idea ‘whose time has come’.

## 5. Why do you think Authentic is the correct publisher for you?

I am very familiar with Paternoster Press, having sold Christian books at several
times in my life. It is a respected publisher, but is not afraid to publish challenging
and controversial material: I was very impressed recently by ‘Atheism After
Christendom’.
