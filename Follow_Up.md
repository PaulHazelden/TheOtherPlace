# Jesus and the Other Place: References to Follow Up

This document is a scratch pad: somewhere to save references which I have identified, 
or which been passed on to me - people, groups and material which may feed in to the
book, or to the process of getting it published.

The website
[Rethinking Hell](https://rethinkinghell.com/) focuses on Conditional Immortality / 
Annihilationism, not on Universalism.

Publication of JatOP probably means publication by American publishers - and 
therefore you need to know who in the US is supporting Conditional 
Immortality - and perhaps get their support and/or interest.

The people reviewing the two books below and/or contributing to them might be 
helpful for endorsement purposes - at least those who are still alive.   Many 
are theologians etc.  Some will no doubt be asked to review JatOP by 
prospective publishers and to give their endorsements.
